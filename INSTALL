Install instructions for clops version 0.2

This file should be located at the root of the binary distribution,
or the root of the snapshot distribution if you have downloaded sources
and everything (the distinction between the 2 is simple, the snapshot
has a src directory).

Install instructions for the binary distribution:
- Set the global variable CLOPS_ROOT.
  The directory bin contains scripts to help you run clops.
  In order to make them work properly you must set an environment variable,
  CLOPS_ROOT to the current root directory of clops, the place where you
  did find this script.
- You might like now to be able to run clops from the command line,
  add the directory bin to your PATH variable.

That's it! You can now run clops by calling the clops command from 
a terminal! 


Install instructions for the source snapshot:
- First run ant on the build.xml specifying the dist target.
  It generates the dist directory, that contains the binary distribution.
- Follow all the steps to install from a binary distribution, but with
  the directory dist/ as the root directory.
