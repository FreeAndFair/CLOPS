Version 0.3.0
- license file

- removed unnecessary runtime classpath

- compile path fix

- don't crash if 'choices' isn't specified for enums

- nested enums in generated datastructures are static

- better error message when -t is not given to CLOPS

- better handling of multiline descriptions

- generation of ant task base class for a given CLOPS description

- (simple) ant task for CLOPS

- quiet mode

- In enum options the generated java enum will respect the order of
  choices given in the CLOPS description. This required a change of
  the syntax for the property "choices" of the type "enum" (and of the
  type "enum-list"), which is now:
  choices="string1|string2(VALUE1),string3(VALUE2)". It is guaranteed
  that VALUE1.compareTo(VALUE2) < 0. This is useful if enum to
  represents verbosity levels, for instance.

- The generated "parse" method now only throws runtime exceptions and
  returns a list or errors that occurred during the parsing of a command
  line. The code for calling "parse" is cleaner as such.

- Parsing of the property "choices" of for the enum option is more
  flexible, spaces and newlines are permitted between the individual
  choices.

- Adding static checks when CLOPS is processing a CLOPS description.
    + Uniqness of individual choices in the "choices" property of the enum option
    + Warning if an option that doesn't exist is used (e.g. in format string)
    + Warning if an option is defined but isn't used in any way by the
      format string and is not virtual.

- Tutorial examples are using the current version of CLOPS, the ant
  test target will fail if they do not parse.

Version 0.2.1
- Fixed the builtin template bug on windows.
 
Version 0.2

- Template name is now taken from the template file, or specified 
  by the user, or taken from the template file name.

- Added templates:
  htmldev

- Enhanced templates:
  html, all the code templates

- string-enum generate a Java enum type

- The option syntax for the command line of CLOPS changed

- Enabled description String for the Name section and the 
  format section in the DSL 

- Improved documentation of CLOPS command-line input. 

- Infinite lookahead parser provided as a method, rather than an option.
