This directory contains a simple example of a CLOPS description for
simulating the program wc (word count).

Run ant in the current directory to generate the parser from the CLOPS
description. The script wc1 is can be used to play with the generated
parser (e.g., "./wc1 -c").

This is an extended version of the example wc which enables specifying
files starting with a hyphen (e.g., ./wc1 -c -- --file).
