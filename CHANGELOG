Version 0.3.0
- license file

- compile path fix

- don't crash if 'choices' isn't specified for enums

- generation of ant task base class for a given CLOPS description

- (simple) ant task for CLOPS

- quiet mode

- In enum options the generated java enum will respect the order of
  choices given in the CLOPS description. This required a change of
  the syntax for the property "choices" of the type "enum" (and of the
  type "enum-list"), which is now:
  choices="string1|string2(VALUE1),string3(VALUE2)". It is guaranteed
  that VALUE1.compareTo(VALUE2) < 0. This is useful if enum to
  represents verbosity levels, for instance.

- The generated "parse" method now only throws runtime exceptions and
  returns a list or errors that occured during the parsin of a command
  line. The code for calling "parse" is cleaner as such.
