Pre-Meeting Notes / Agenda 14th October 2008
--------------------------------------------
  
It should be recorded how the library is to be used.
It is almost the same, but focused on interactions between objects in the system.
What the key components in the system are.
and how they interact.
Yes, for CLOPS, the components are the rules, options, parser, command line, format ...
You might want to have some sort of user-point-of-view descritpion
But maybe a high level of abstraction is sufficient for such
for instgance, if a new user comes
I want to present him with concepts like "commandline dependencies description"
rather than rules etc
 We can have different levels of abstraction in BON. The top-level abstractions would be the command-line, dependencies and description.
 so that's where you could start from
the highest level of abstraction description
 Yes - we could use the whiteboard and then I would make a note of all the clusters of concepts
