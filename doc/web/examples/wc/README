This directory contains a simple example of a CLOPS description for
simulating the program wc (word count).

This version of the CLOPS description does not enable the user to
specify a file starting with a hyphen; see the example wc1.

Run ant in the current directory to generate the parser from the CLOPS
description. The script wc is can be used to play with the generated
parser (e.g., "./wc -c").
