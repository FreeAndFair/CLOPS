explanation 
  "A parser is one of the components in an interpreter or compiler, which checks for correct \
  \syntax and builds a data structure (often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or \
  \other hierarchical structure) implicit in the input tokens.  parsing, or, more formally, \
  \syntactic analysis, is the process of analyzing a sequence of tokens to determine their \
  \grammatical structure with respect to a given (more or less) formal grammar."

class GENERIC_PARSER description "Non-configurable subcomponent of the comamnd line parser"
class SPECIFIC_PARSER description "Configurable subcomponent of the command line parser"
